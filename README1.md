# JSL01: Syntax-Engine Interaction
# Introduction
The task was to build a virtual pet adoption website, but use a JavaScript function to take a string as input and validate if it follows a specific syntax.

# Elements Included
Function declaration, local variables, validation logic, result element, and HTML output.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
**Code Readability and Organization:** I believe I was able to present well-structured code with clear variable names (petInput, regex, isValid, resultElement) and the comments enhanced readability.
**DOM Manipulation:** Using document.getElementById() to access and manipulate HTML elements shows proficiency in DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, which is essential for interactive web development.

# Challenges Faced
Using regular expressions (regex) to define a pattern for syntax validation was something I found particularly challenging, even with the cheatsheet, it took awhile for me to grasp.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project was a great introduction into learning how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. As well as providing practical exposure to accessing and manipulating HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
